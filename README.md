With this tool, you can filter files containing URL type leaks ðŸ¦ . For example: Url:email:password . For example: instagram.com. All Instagram-related accounts will then be saved in a file.

- You specify the name of the site you want to extract accounts from
- For example: instagram.com
- All Instagram-related accounts will then be

## It includes other options such as:

- Extract from one site
- Extract from all sites
- Search for an account
- Extract emails and passwords
- Filter accounts

I have provided 6 files (data) that you can use to extract accounts . If you need new data files, you can download them from the sites :

> leakforum.io
> nulled.to
> cracked.io

You will find the tool in exe format so that you can use it directly on Windows and also find its source code ðŸ–¥ if you want to run it on your phone ðŸ¥¬or Kali LinuxðŸ–¥.  

## Note:

I have placed the files (data) in another folder because they are too large and difficult to download.

```sh
sudo git clone https://github.com/vv1ck/Hurricane
